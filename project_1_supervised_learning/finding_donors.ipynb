    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "** Please note ** that the the purpose of generating a naive predictor is simply to show what a base model without any intelligence would look like. In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve.

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "* Don't have to worry about features being correlated\n",
    "* You can easily update your model to take in new data (unlike Decision Trees or SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages: \n",
    "* Deals bad with outliers\n",
    "* Must have lots of incomes for each class\n",
    "* Presence of multicollinearity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real use:\n",
    "* Some obese people get gastric bypass surgery to lose weight, and some of them die as a result of the surgery. Benotti et al. (2014) wanted to know whether they could predict who was at a higher risk of dying from one particular kind of surgery, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. They obtained records on 81,751 patients who had had Roux-en-Y surgery, of which 123 died within 30 days. They did multiple logistic regression, with alive vs. dead after 30 days as the dependent variable, and 6 demographic variables (gender, age, race, body mass index, insurance type, and employment status) and 30 health variables (blood pressure, diabetes, tobacco use, etc.) as the independent variables. Manually choosing the variables to add to their logistic model, they identified six that contribute to risk of dying from Roux-en-Y surgery: body mass index, age, gender, pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, and liver disease. —> from http://www.biostathandbook.com/multiplelogistic.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use it:\n",
    "It is a simple model, that is very easy to implement. We won't have to worry about feature correlation and our data probably won't have outliers, that could be prejudicial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ensemble Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "* Harder to overfit\n",
    "* Usually better perfomance than a single model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages:\n",
    "* Scaling —> usually it trains several models, which can have a bad performance with larger datasets\n",
    "* Hard to implement in real time platform\n",
    "* Complexity increases\n",
    "* Boosting delivers poor probability estimates (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1207/1207.1403.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real case:\n",
    "* AdaBoosting was used to detect baseball players game analysis (https://www.uni-obuda.hu/journal/Markoski_Ivankovic_Ratgeber_Pecev_Glusac_57.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use it:\n",
    "Overfit is a problem and we can avoid it with ensemble methods. Also, it can result in better models than a single model. Although it is harder to scale, we are currently not worried about this, so it can be very useful for our current data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gaussian Naive Bayes \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "* Need less training data tran models like logistic regression\n",
    "* Highly scalable\n",
    "* Not sensitive to irrelevant features\n",
    "* Returns the degree of certanty of the answer\n",
    "* Good when you need something fast and that perfoms well\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disavantages:\n",
    "* Can't learn interactions between features e.g., it can’t learn that although you love movies with Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise, you hate movies where they’re together).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real case:\n",
    "* Emotion recognition with Gaussian Naive Bayes (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1044578/)\n",

The Gaussian Naive Bayes did not achieve good results neither on train or test sets. Since it is more important that our test results should be more accurate on the test set and I am considering that time to execute is important, I considered the Logistic Regression the best model for this case, both for now and  considering future scenarios with larger datasets."

    "The goal of this study is to predict if a person has an income bigger than 50k dolars. Knowing which person has this kind of income, we can direct our efforts on gathering donations. This way we will increase efficiency and lower our costs. For this purpose, we used a dataset that contains data of 45222 people. This dataset contains personal information such as age and occupation that can be used to predict the income. \n",

    "After cleaning our dataset to reduce inconsistences, we divided our initial dataset into 2 separate datasets: a train dataset (80% of the initial dataset) and a test dataset (20%). This is a common practice that allow us to train an algorithm with a dataset and test it with another dataset, which contains information that the model doesn't know. This way, the algorithm will not be influenced by past data and we can check its accuracy on unknow data. For this purpose, we initially evaluated tree models and selected the best model, which was an algorithm called Logistic Regressionm which gave a ~80% accuracy score and a Fbeta of ~0.6 and, thus, it can be considered a good model."

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
